# PYTHON-ASSIGNMENT

This project is a simple voice-controlled assistant built using JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. Just like Iron Man’s Jarvis, this assistant listens to your voice commands and performs useful tasks like:

🟢 Sending WhatsApp messages

📞 Making calls or video calls on WhatsApp

📝 Opening Notepad ,Youtube and etc on voice command

📂 Keeping track of your search history

It’s a hands-free experience designed to make everyday actions faster and easier — all using just your voice!

And also this was a task for me im still learning new things and i have learned alot of new things while making this project and also solved some new problems which i have never seen .I also took some help from google ,youtube,and ChatGpt.
